## Overview

The overall project was developed with the highest industry standards in mind, in terms of widely accepted notions in the developer world. We made sure to organize ourselves with a the MVC model (Models Views Controllers) in order to ensure the skillset we gained would be applicable to the real world. In addition, we chose to create a true single page application with the use of react-router-dom and express. With these goals in mind, we felt we met our personal goals to foster a product that utilizes the latest technologies with the added benefit of scalability.

## Front-End

A users' experience can only be as good as the technology in the User Interface. For this reason we used a commbination of Reactstrap and Material UI. Both being the most popular and relevant libararies in the current tech environment. Especially because of the rise in popularity of React and their component based coding model which emphasizes modularity; for a better user and developer experience.

## Back-End

The goal of our backend was optimization in order to lighten the load for our front-end. We used MongoDB to it's full potential to sort, group, and aggregate our data. In doing so, we were able to create API routes that are seemingly complex, without the sacrifice of front-end efficiency.
